<p>
  A few weeks ago, I finished rewriting <a href="https://github.com/tomBoddaert/site">site</a>,
  the templating program I use to build this website. This is currently the only project I
  maintain in <a href="https://go.dev/">go</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The two main goals for this rewrite were to make it more configurable for the end user and
  to make the code much neater. Although I'm not so sure about the second goal, the new
  version is definitly more configurable.
</p>

<p>
  Site v2's main addition is the
  <a href="https://github.com/tomBoddaert/site/tree/95f7a3c75c70c951873f88fdb845737770e5825e#siteconfigjson"><code>siteConfig.json</code></a>
  file, which allows the user to set several parameters including the input and output directories,
  which were previously hard-coded. I also added <a href="http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/">sprig</a>'s
  functions, which provides many utilities that can be used directly in the templates.
</p>

<p>
  This new version also comes with an <a href="https://gist.github.com/tomBoddaert/29b17843f88be23ea8e36bebf331834f">updated example site</a>
  to display the main features.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to take a look at the code behind it, it's on
