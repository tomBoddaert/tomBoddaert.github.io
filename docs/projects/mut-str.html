<p>
  A couple of months ago, I was doing a challenge on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>
  and I thought I could make an optimisation by using mutable string slices to avoid
  allocation.
</p>

<p>
  After a quick Google search, I found out that mutable string slices are almost useless in
  Rust. The standard library does provide functions to convert ASCII characters to upper or
  lower case but there is little functionality for the rest of the UTF-8 range.
</p>

<h3>UTF-8</h3>

<p>
  Rust uses UTF-8 for its strings, which uses variable length encoding. This means that a
  character can be anywhere from 1 to 4 bytes long. This makes string manipulation
  significantly harder, especially when in-place, as one string with 10 characters may not
  be the same size as another with the same number of characters. Slicing a type is usually
  a very simple thing in Rust, but with strings, if you try to slice at a byte that is not
  a boundary between two characters, it will fail.
</p>

<p>
  You've probably heard that Rust's safety system is great, but did you know that within safe
  Rust, all UTF-8 strings and string slices must be valid. In other words, it is impossible
  to construct an invalid string in safe and sound Rust. This is done so that the functions
  using strings can make the assumption that they are valid, which makes them easier to write
  and use. This is also the reason
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html#method.as_bytes_mut"><code>str::as_bytes_mut</code></a>
  is unsafe. If it was not, you could easily corrupt a string.
</p>

<h3>Mutable UTF-8 Strings</h3>

<p>
  After some experimenting and a lot of soundness testing, I wrote
  <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mut-str"><code>mut-str</code></a>, a library that provides
  safe functions for accessing and manipulating strings in-place. It uses character indexes
  rather than byte indexes and even has a
  <a href="https://docs.rs/mut-str/1.0.1/mut_str/struct.Char.html">UTF-8 character reference type</a>,
  which represents a single character in a similar way to how the
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.str.html"><code>str</code> type</a>
  represents a string of characters.
</p>

<p>
  If you would like to use <code>mut-str</code> yourself, it is on
  <a href="https://crates.io/crates/mut-str">crates.io</a>, and the
  documentation is on <a href="https://docs.rs/mut-str/latest/mut_str/">docs.rs</a>.
