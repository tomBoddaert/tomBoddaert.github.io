<p>
  For the last few months, the main thing I have been working on in the
  <a href="https://github.com/tomBoddaert/dyn-slice">dyn-slice</a> library has been trying to make
  the declarative macro accept more traits. The main issue was that I couldn't figure out a way to
  accept traits with generic parameters, lifetimes or constants. I was repeatedly writing and
  re-writing the macro with increasing complexity. I kept finding roadblocks to fully generalising
  it.

  <summary><h3>The Delay</h3></summary>
  <p>
    I originally started writing this on 29/01/2024, but due to coursework and loosing interest in
    this several times, I didn't get round to finishing and publishing it until much later.

<h3>Procedural Macros</h3>

<p>
  Eventually, I took a look at procedural macros. I had only written
  <a href="https://github.com/tomBoddaert/FSM/blob/139c94510829e13a127f51bd09fd3c4f1b6070ab/fsm_derive/lib/lib.rs">one</a>
  before and it was very basic. Procedural macros (also known as proc macros) are written in Rust
  rather than with the
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/macros-by-example.html">"by example" syntax</a>.
  Combined with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn">syn</a> and
  <a href="https://crates.io/crates/quote">quote</a> crates, proc macros are actually not that
  difficult to write.
</p>

<h3>Advice</h3>

<p>
  If you want to write your own proc macros, then I recommend the following:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Read through the README examples for <a href="https://crates.io/crates/quote/1.0.35">quote</a>
      and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn/2.0.53">syn</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implement the
      <a href="https://docs.rs/syn/2.0.53/syn/parse/trait.Parse.html"><code>Parse</code></a> trait,
      mostly using the implementations in <a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn/2.0.53">syn</a>
      (<a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice-macros/3.2.0/src/dyn_slice_macros/declare_new_fns.rs.html#25-53">
        Example from <code>dyn-slice-macros</code>
      </a>). <br>
      If you are adding some syntax that is not in
      <a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn/2.0.53">syn</a>, then look at similar syntax in it that
      you can base your code off of (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn/2.0.53">syn</a> is
      MIT + Apache 2.0 licensed).
      <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice-macros/3.2.0/src/dyn_slice_macros/declare_new_fns.rs.html#55-78">I used this</a>
      to optionally parse some generics.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/quote/1.0.35">quote</a> to produce the output tokens
      (<a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice-macros/3.2.0/src/dyn_slice_macros/declare_new_fns.rs.html#254-377">
        <code>dyn-slice-macros</code> example
      </a>).
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Complications</h1>

<p>
  There were a couple of issues I came across when creating this.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>
    For compatibility, a nice API and sanitisation, I opted to have the macro generate a module
    that holds the generated functions. This meant that I had to prefix every path that comes from
    the outer scope with <code>super::</code>. <br>
    This was a pain and
    <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice-macros/3.2.0/src/dyn_slice_macros/path_ext.rs.html">the solution</a>
    accounts for a substantial portion of the code.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    Proc macros must exist in their own special crate. This is fine if your library only contains
    proc macros, but if you are in the more likely situation of having a macro as part of a larger
    crate, then you will have to split the code. <br>
    I used a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html">workspace</a> but a
    completely seperate crate would work just fine (and probably be easier). Then you can add the
    macro crate as a dependency and re-export (<code>pub use</code>) the macro.
  </p></li>
</ol>
