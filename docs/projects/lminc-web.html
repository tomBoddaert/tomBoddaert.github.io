  After the <a href="/projects#lminc-rewrite">rewrite of LMinC</a>, the Little Minion/Man Computer
  assembler and simulator, the library can now be compiled to WASM (due to the new no_std support).
  So, I had the idea of creating an in-browser front-end that could assemble and run LMinC programs.

<h3>The Rust/JS Interface</h3>

<p>
  To interface between Rust and JS, there are projects like
  <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>, which produce great bindings, but
  I decided I wanted to write my own interface, which was surprisingly easy.
</p>

<p>
  I started off with a Rust library that targeted wasm32-unknown-unknown, and exported its methods using
  extern bindings. From the JS side, I first needed to
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Loading_and_running">load the WASM file</a>,
  then I could start running the functions in Rust. As only 32-bit integers can be sent from JS to WASM,
  text transfer has to be done using the module instance's memory. I used the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder">TextEncoder</a> and
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder">TextDecoder</a> APIs to encode
  and decode strings to and from the instance's memory. Overall, this was actually quite a fun thing to
  do and relatively painless compared to what I was dreading.
</p>

<h3>Creating the editor</h3>

<p>
  In order to make this useful, I needed a way to write/input assembly in the browser. At first, I tried using
  <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">Monaco</a>, the same code editor used in VSCode,
  but after finding out there is no way of loading it from a CDN without either some hacky JS, or another
  "loader" script, I decided to try <a href="https://ace.c9.io/">Ace</a>. Ace was a much more pleasant
  experience (by which I mean I didn't want to abandon it before getting it to load), however there
  was not much documentation. I ended up mostly using the examples on the
  <a href="https://ace.c9.io/#nav=howto">"How-To Guide" page</a> for setting up the editor and the <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/b85cf8f2dc4eae0edff6ae29ddbb0dfad0418334/src/mode/assembly_x86_highlight_rules.js">
    x86_64 highlighting rules
  </a> source for creating the syntax highlighter.
</p>

<p>
  Side note: I have been spoiled by documentation on 3rd party Rust crates and had completely forgotten
  how non-existent JS documentation can get (MDN is great though).
</p>

<p>
  Once I had Ace loaded in the page, I added some tabs, which quickly got much more complicated than I
  was originally envisioning. For some reason, I had the idea of making the adjacent, inactive tabs merge
  with a separator line, which I eventually managed to pull off without JS. Finally, I just had to add some
  buttons and link the editor to the Rust interface.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, I am pretty happy with this project. It is a bit messy but I did not spend much time on it.
  If you want to try it out yourself, it is hosted at <a href="https://lminc.tomboddaert.com/">lminc.tomboddaert.com</a>
  and on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/tomBoddaert/lminc-web">github.com/<wbr>tomBoddaert/lminc-web</a>
  (go give it a ‚≠ê).
