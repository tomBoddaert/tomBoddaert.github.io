<p>
  Since the <a href="/projects#dyn-slice-3.0.0">last post on dyn-slice</a>, I have continued obsessing
  over the idea and making improvements. But wait a moment; version 3.0.0? What happened to versions
  1 and 2?
</p>

<p>
  The first stable version I released was version 1.0.0, I was very happy with it, but I made a
  huge mistake. Rust was designed to be a memory safe language, and it does a great job of it but
  sometimes, us programmers need a bit more control. This is where unsafe
  code comes in. The idea of unsafe code is to give us complete control of the memory, and in
  return, we make a promise to the compiler that our code is memory safe. Then, our code can be
  used from a safe environment and it shouldn't violate memory safety.
</p>

<h3>Unsoundness</h3>

<p>
  It <em>shouldn't</em> violate memory safety, but if the programmer who wrote the unsafe code
  made a mistake, it might. If a library can be used to violate memory safety with only
  safe code, it is considered
  <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#soundness-of-code--of-a-library">'unsound'</a>.
  As Rust is supposed to be a memory safe language, accidentally writing unsound code is one
  the biggest mistakes you can make in a Rust library.
</p>

<p>
  dyn-slice 1.0.0 is unsound. I missed one thing. One unsafe block that did something that
  wasn't memory safe. One. The problem was in the
  <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice/1.0.0/dyn_slice/standard/struct.DebugDynSlice.html#method.metadata">
      <code>metadata</code> method
  </a>. If an empty dyn slice was created, its
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/struct.DynMetadata.html"><code>DynMetadata</code></a>
  would be set to a null pointer, which was fine for accessing the elements, as in an empty
  slice, there are no elements to access. But, the 
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/struct.DynMetadata.html"><code>DynMetadata</code></a>
  struct has some methods on it that require it to be valid. My
  <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice/1.0.0/dyn_slice/standard/struct.DebugDynSlice.html#method.metadata">
    <code>metadata</code> method
  </a> could return an invalid instance of
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/struct.DynMetadata.html"><code>DynMetadata</code></a>.
  Trying to access any of the methods on
  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/struct.DynMetadata.html"><code>DynMetadata</code></a>
  would result in a segfault, all in
  <a href="https://github.com/tomBoddaert/dyn-slice/issues/2#issue-1810047532">assumed safe Rust</a>.

<h3>Version 2.0.0</h3>

<p>
  The fact that I missed this really annoyed me, so I went to fix it. However, fixing it would be a
  breaking change, and as per <a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">semver</a>, I would have
  to increment the major version. Therefore, the fixed version is 2.0.0. The fix was to store a
  possibly-null, vtable pointer (<code>*const ()</code>), and then have the
  <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice/2.0.0/dyn_slice/standard/struct.DebugDynSlice.html#method.metadata">
    new <code>metadata</code> method
  </a> return an <code>Option&lt;DynMetadata&gt;</code>.
</p>

<h3>Version 3.0.0</h3>

<p>
  Previously, a new dyn slice struct would be created per trait, which was less than ideal.
  In version 3.0.0, there is a single
  <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice/3.0.0/dyn_slice/struct.DynSlice.html">
    <code>DynSlice&lt;Dyn&gt;</code> struct
  </a>, which is much simpler. A macro is still required to declare 'new' functions, but it generates
  significantly less code than before. There are also some predefined 'new' functions in the
  <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice/3.0.0/dyn_slice/standard/index.html"><code>standard</code> module</a>.
  I also added a few more features, including mutability with
  <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice/3.0.0/dyn_slice/struct.DynSliceMut.html">
    <code>DynSliceMut&lt;Dyn&gt;</code>
  </a>.
</p>

  If you would like to play around with the new version yourself, it is on
  <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dyn-slice/3.0.0">crates.io</a>, and the
  documentation is on <a href="https://docs.rs/dyn-slice/3.0.0/dyn_slice/">docs.rs</a>.
